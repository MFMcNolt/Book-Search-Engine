# Book Search Engine
## Description
This project is a Book Search Engine that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The motivation behind building this project was to create a platform where users can easily find and save books based on their preferences. The Book Search Engine solves the problem of efficiently searching and managing a personal library of books. Through this project, I learned how to integrate a GraphQL API using Apollo Server, connect it to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and implement authentication for user-specific features.
